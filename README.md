# ruby-graphviz-mindmap

So this actually isn't using the ruby GraphViz library right now, but I mean to make it do so. It mostly just generates [dot][1] format files at the moment.

## Installation

You need [graphviz][2] installed. On ubuntu it's just `sudo apt-get install graphviz`

Then `gem install ruby-graphviz-mindmap`

## Usage

Create a script in which you layout your mind map:

    require 'ruby-graphviz-mindmap'
    map = GraphViz::MindMap.build "foo", overlap: false
    map.node 'baz', color: :red, shape: :box do
      node 'bar' do
        node 'ha'
      end 

      node 'two', color: :blue do
        inherit!
        node 'three' do
          node 'Four And'
          node 'ha', color: :green
        end 
      end 
    end 

    File.open('output.dot', 'wb'){|f| f << map.to_dot }

That will output a dot file ready for processing with a graphviz
command. I like `neato` for this ([documentation on neato][3]):

    neato -Tjpeg output.dot -o output.jpg

You'll get something that looks like this:
